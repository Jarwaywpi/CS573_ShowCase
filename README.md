####Question 2: I want to check the frenquencies and ratios of each car type.
In parallel coordinates chart, they visualized "Hot Car" frequency count within 5 years. They calculated the ratios by using count divided by its "TotalNumber". "AvgMRatio" stands for average ratio for each car type in a certain month within 5 years. "AvgRatio" is the average AvgMRatio within all these months.
